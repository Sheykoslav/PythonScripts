Utility that will detect encrypted/compressed files in a specified directory.

Command line arguments:

(The parameters for sorting are different from those given in the task. I don't think that
it would be a big deal)

  c. -ds, --descending: all files in the program output should be sorted by confidence level descending (from high to low).
  
  d. -as, --ascending: all files in the program output should be sorted by confidence level ascending (from low to high).
